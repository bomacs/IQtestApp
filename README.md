# Hi there!

This is my first build app.
But before anything else, in order to run the code, do install first the neccessary libraries written in the requirements.txt together with the Quiz.csv too.
IQtestApp is an app that uses computer vision library known as OPENCV.
Using the app, user's IQ will be tested wether its in what level.

Happy coding everyone.

See output folder for the sample output.
